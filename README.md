# TempSensor-PIC24

Maintaining a specific temperature is essential for equipment used to fabricate medical drugs and
components in computers. For applications like these, the responsiveness and
accuracy of the temperature detection system can be critical for quality control. TMP36 as an
example is a high precision, wide range, & low power analog thermometers provides temperature
readings over a -40°C to +125°C range. The sensor outputs an analog voltage that is
proportional to the ambient temperature. Therefore, reading analog inputs is an important task
for microcontrollers. In this project, the temperature sensor TMP36 is interfaced
to PIC24 MCU using Proteus 8.11 VSM viewer.

- Used MPLABX IDE to compile the C code used to program the Microcontroller
- Used Proteus VSM 8.11 to implement a virtual PIC24 Microcontroller with added components
